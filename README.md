## Setup

### Virtual Environment

This project uses a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies. Follow these steps to set up:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   In terminal do:
   python -m venv venv

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   **Windows:**
   venv\Scripts\activate
   **macOS/Linux:**
   source venv/bin/activate
   You should see `(venv)` appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.

3. Installing Dependencies
   With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Deactivating Virtual Env

When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment:
In terminal run:
deactivate
